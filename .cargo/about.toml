# Workaround for GPL-2.0 deprecated identifier error
# Some dependencies have LICENSE files containing deprecated GPL-2.0 identifier
# instead of GPL-2.0-only or GPL-2.0-or-later. Since cargo-about cannot parse deprecated
# identifiers in LICENSE files (only in Cargo.toml), we skip scanning and manually
# clarify licenses for crates that would trigger this error.
