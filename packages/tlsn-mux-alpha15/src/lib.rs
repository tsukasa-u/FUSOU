//! A multiplexing library for TLSNotary.
//!
//! It multiplexes independent I/O streams over reliable, ordered connections,
//! such as TCP/IP.
//!
//! The two primary objects, clients of this crate interact with, are:
//!
//! - [`Connection`], which wraps the underlying I/O resource, e.g. a socket,
//!   and provides methods for opening outbound or accepting inbound streams.
//! - [`Stream`], which implements [`futures::io::AsyncRead`] and
//!   [`futures::io::AsyncWrite`].
