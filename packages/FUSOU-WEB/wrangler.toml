# ===== Environment Variables =====
# Note: Do NOT hardcode variables in wrangler.toml.
# - Development: keep non-secret config in .env via dotenvx
# - Production (Cloudflare Pages): set environment variables in the Pages Dashboard
#   e.g. Settings → Environment Variables → add SCHEMA_FINGERPRINTS_JSON

# ===== Service Bindings =====
# Connect to separate Workers

# ===== R2 Bucket Bindings =====

# ===== Scheduled cron triggers =====
# Note: Cloudflare Pages does not support scheduled functions via wrangler.toml
# Alternative approaches:
#
# Option 1: External Cron Service (Recommended)
#   Use GitHub Actions, Cloudflare Workers Cron, or other cron services to call:
#   POST https://your-site.pages.dev/api/compaction/trigger-scheduled
#
# Option 2: Cloudflare Workers Cron (Separate Worker)
#   Create a separate Worker with cron trigger that calls the endpoint
#
# Option 3: Manual Trigger
#   Call the endpoint manually when needed for testing

# ===== WASM Module Rules =====
